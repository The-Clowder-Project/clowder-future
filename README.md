## Chapters currently being written

### Relations

There are a few things regarding relations which I'm hoping to understand better and add to the Clowder Project:
- Relations admit a few other notions of composition besides the usual one, such as the apartness composition of relations and the “xor” composition, given by $`(S\circ R)^{c}_{a}=\int^{b\in B}S^{c}_{b}\mathbin{\text{xor}}R^{b}_{a}`$. It would be interesting to investigate the properties of the 2-category of relations equipped with these composition laws, e.g. what internal monads in $\mathbf{Rel}$ are with respect to these compositions.
- A better understanding of co/limits in $`\mathbf{Rel}`$ is in order, there are many things one could add about these to the Clowder project which are currently missing from there.
- Material on the Kan extensions/lifts $`\mathrm{Ran}_{J}(J)`$, $`\mathrm{Lan}_{J}(J)`$, $`\mathrm{Rift}_{J}(J)`$, and $`\mathrm{Lift}_{J}(J)`$ as co/density co/monads.
- An exploration of relative co/monads in $`\mathbf{Rel}`$, defined as co/monoids in $`\mathbf{Rel}(A,B)`$ with respect to the left/right skew monoidal structure of Tags [00MN](https://www.clowderproject.com/tag/00MN.html) and [00N1](https://www.clowderproject.com/tag/00N1.html).
- Material on internal fibrations in $`\mathbf{Rel}`$, such as discrete fibrations and Street fibrations.
- Perhaps sections “The Monoidal Bicategory of Relations” and “The Monoidal Double Category of Relations” could be instructive examples of monoidal bicategories/double categories.
- Some material needs to be reorganized/polished.

### Spans

A very large amount of things need to be done here. A comprehensive outline of what's missing and what's not will be added here in the future.

### Indexed Sets, Fibred Sets, and Un/Straightening

These chapters are essentially “0-categorical indexed/fibred category theory” and are almost complete, with only a few proofs and results missing here and there.

### Presheaves and the Yoneda Lemma

A couple things are currently missing here:
- Statement and proof of the universal property of categories of co/presheaves as free co/completions.
- A better study of the restricted Yoneda embedding, following [MO 468854](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/468854/consequences-of-imposing-conditions-on-the-restricted-yoneda-embedding-of-a-func)

### Isbell Duality
The following results are missing:
- What are the algebras for the Isbell monad on BA for A a monoid?
- A better understanding of Isbell duality for simplicial sets ([MO 469066](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/469066/isbell-duality-for-simplicial-sets))
- A study of the “duality pairing” maps $\mathcal{F}\boxtimes_{\mathcal{C}}\mathsf{O}(\mathcal{F})\to\mathsf{Tr}(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mathsf{Spec}(F)\boxtimes_{\mathcal{C}}F\to\mathsf{Tr}(\mathcal{C})$, which are generalisations of the map $V\times V^*\to k$ given by $(v,\phi)\mapsto\phi(v)$ for $V$ a $k$-vector space.

### Centres and Traces of Categories

A better outline of what's missing here will be added in the future.

### The Simplex Category

A better outline of what's missing here will be added in the future.

### The Cycle Category

A better outline of what's missing here will be added in the future.

### The Cube Category

A better outline of what's missing here will be added in the future.
